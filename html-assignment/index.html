        I'm currently studying Interactive Media Design at Algonquin College, and I absolutely love it. 
        <br>
        The program is a perfect mix of creativity and technology, which really speaks to me. 
        <br>
        I'm always excited to learn new design skills 
        and explore how media can impact people in unique ways. 
    </p>
    <p>
        On top of that, my friends and family mean the world to me. 
        <br>
        They are  my biggest source of support, and I try to keep a balance between my studies and spending time with them.
